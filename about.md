Dr. Kevin Martinez-Folgar is a physician and epidemiologist in training with expertise in chronic disease epidemiology and prevention. Dr. Martinez-Folgar is currently a Doctoral Research Fellow with the Urban Health Collaborative at the Dornsife School of Public health. Dr. Martinez-Folgar trained as a physician in the University of San Carlos of Guatemala, and currently is a third year PhD candidate in Epidemiology at Drexel University. He also received training in measures of physical activity for population health from the National Institute of Public Health in Mexico. He has experience using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in geospatial analysis and multilevel analysis. He has conducted research on chronic diseases and urban environments but also related to political engagement with stakeholders. Dr. Martinez-Folgar has published 12 manuscripts in indexed journals, and his research has covered mortality and life expectancy across Latin American cities [4], healthcare access [1], or the health consequences of urban scaling. Importantly for this proposal, Dr. Martinez-Folgar published the first description of excess mortality in Guatemala [3] and collaborated with other researchers to publish the first comparison of excess mortality across Latin American countries [2]. Dr Martinez-Folgar had a first-hand experience during his clinical training of how healthcare access limitations and the social determinants of health have shaped the health of populations, particularly in underserved populations.  This experience has created a strong motivation to do population health research and policy advocacy to lead change. In the future, he would seek a postdoctoral position which would prepare him for a prospective academic appointment where he can better develop his research agenda while training public health professionals.
